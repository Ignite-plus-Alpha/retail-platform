        Founded in 2020 by IgnitePlus, Alpha has come a long way from its beginnings in a  home office Bangalore, India. When IgnitePlus 
        first started out, our passion for  helping other parents be more eco-friendly,   drove us to  do intense research,  and gave us 
        the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online store. We now serve customers all over India  and are thrilled 
        to be a part of the   eco-friendly,  wing of the  fashion industry.</p>
        <p>We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't 
            hesitate to contact us.</p>
